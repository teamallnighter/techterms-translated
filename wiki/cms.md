## CMS

A CMS, or content management system, is a platform that allows less-techy people to build websites and content from professionally designed templates. More tech-savvy users can often further customize these templates or website themes with HTML edits or plug-ins, which you'll learn more about on this list. Notable examples of CMSs include WordPress and WIx.
